# Kafka API Data Analysis Pipeline 🚀📊

This project demonstrates a data analysis pipeline that integrates an API with Kafka for real-time data processing and storage. The pipeline includes a Kafka consumer that processes incoming Bitcoin price data from the [Blockchain.info Ticker API](https://blockchain.info/ticker) and saves the results in CSV files.

## Project Overview 🧑‍💻

The pipeline includes the following components:
- **API with Kafka**: A Python API (`api_with_kafka.py`) that fetches real-time Bitcoin price data from the Blockchain.info Ticker API and pushes it to Kafka.
- **Kafka Consumer**: A script (`consumer.py`) that reads data from Kafka, processes it, and saves results to CSV files.
- **Data Output**: Includes `buy_prices.csv` and `historical_data.csv` for analysis.

## Files in the Repository 📂

1. **`api_with_kafka.py`**  
   - This script sets up an API that fetches real-time Bitcoin price data from the [Blockchain.info Ticker API](https://blockchain.info/ticker) and sends it to Kafka. It streams real-time price updates for various currencies.

2. **`consumer.py`**  
   - This script is a Kafka consumer that listens for Bitcoin price data from the API, processes it, and performs analysis tasks. Results are stored in CSV files.

3. **`buy_prices.csv`**  
   - Contains processed data with Bitcoin buy prices for various currencies. This file is generated by `consumer.py` and includes calculated metrics for minimum, maximum, and average buy prices for each currency.

4. **`historical_data.csv`**  
   - Stores raw real-time Bitcoin price data for different currencies processed by the Kafka consumer. This file is useful for tracking price fluctuations over time.

## Getting Started ⚡

### Prerequisites 📦

To run this project, you need:
- **Python 3** 
- **Kafka** installed and running on your local machine or server
- **Kafka-Python** library installed:
  ```bash
  pip install kafka-python

### Running the API 🚀
1. Start Kafka on your local machine.
2. Run `api_with_kafka.py` to start sending data to the Kafka topic:
   ```bash
   python api_with_kafka.py

### Running the Consumer 📥
With Kafka running and `api_with_kafka.py` pushing data, start the Kafka consumer to process incoming data:
```bash
python consumer.py
```
### Expected Output 📈
**buy_prices.csv**: Contains a summary of real-time Bitcoin buy prices for various currencies, including minimum, maximum, and average values based on the data fetched from the Blockchain.info Ticker API.
- **historical_data.csv**: Logs raw Bitcoin price data in real-time for different currencies, providing a historical record of Bitcoin market fluctuations.

### Future Improvements 🚧
- Add more complex data processing tasks (e.g., trend analysis, moving averages) based on Bitcoin price data.
- Integrate with a visualization tool for real-time monitoring of Bitcoin prices.
- Add error handling and logging for production use.
